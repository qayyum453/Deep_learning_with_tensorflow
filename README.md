# Deep_learning_with_tensorflow
The text classification using Deep learning Techniques using keras and Tensorflow

In This project I used advance method of deep learning like Conv1D and MaxPooling1D for doing to text classification into different categories.

I implented these methods using python powerfull built in packages of Keras and Tensorflow.

The data is composed of users using a selling a website and than passing their review on the products or services.

The aim of the project is to predict the tag_Value of new comments from users automatically.
